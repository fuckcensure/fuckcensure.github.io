For several years, journalists and researchers had suspected the installation of "re-education" camps for Uyghur minorities in China.

A fairly comprehensive report published in **November 2018** by the **Australian Strategic Policy Institute** (ASPI) gathered evidence, especially from **satellite images** of **the existence of these camps**.

## The Uyghur population in China

Uyghurs are a **Turkish-speaking** and **Sunni Muslim people** living in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.

![map mulsim in china](assets/images/posts/2020-10-03-map-muslim-in-china.jpg)

They are **11 million** of the **14 million Muslims** in the region. It is estimated that at least **800,000** of them **are locked up in camps**. The **repression** against **the Uyghurs** has especially increased since **the deadly riots** of **2009**.

China, which initially **denied this political** and **police repression**, ended up **admitting the existence of these camps** "*to educate*" the Uyghur population.

## Xinjiang Internment Camps

These are camps located in the **Chinese province of Xinjiang**, built from **2014** with the aim of interning hundreds of thousands of practicing *Uyghur* and *Kazakh* **Muslims**. **One million Uyghurs** are believed to be interned there preventively and **without trial** as part of **a vast anti-terrorism campaign** targeting *Islamists* and *separatists* after numerous attacks in 2013 and 2014.

China **denies the existence of these camps** before officially recognizing their existence in **October 2018** under the name of "*re-education camps*". She describes them as vocational training centers, with the aim of combating Muslim terrorism and extremism.

Abroad, several countries and **NGOs** qualify these camps as **concentration camps** and stress the conditions of detention which **violate human rights**.

As we can see from the evolution of this camp, over the **2.5-year** period covered by a report from January 18, 2016 to September 2018, the facility increased from **5 to 24 buildings or wings**. Its total floor area increased during this period, from **12,200 m²** to **129,600 m²**. This represents a size increase of **1062.3%**.

Through **satellite** and **imagery** analysis, the **physical features** of the camp - including **barricaded facilities**, **watchtowers** and **enclosures surrounded by barbed wire** - can be clearly seen. This also makes it possible to **prove** that it is indeed a **camp to lock up Muslims**.

The [ASPI report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR48u6lKYD21gv6mqM-2dV2lL8axuJ3yG5QJr2KNfG6bZNhy2dXDib_ZyFl9QKwvTRP0EBKZPYczwp9/pubhtml) covers **28 camps**, which represents only a sample of re-education camps in Xinjiang estimated at **more than a 100th**, or **even 1200** if the provisional camps are taken into account. The study shows that the size of these camps **increased sharply** between **2016** and **2018**.

Which leads us to wonder if the situation has only **worsened**, from the start, to what could be described **as genocide**.

## Mass espionage of the Uyghur population

A [Lookout Threat Intelligence](https://www.lookout.com/documents/threat-reports/us/lookout-uyghur-malware-tr-us.pdf) report found that China was using **malware** to **track** the Uyghur people. This surveillance activity was observed as early as **2013**. Four Android tools are used in this **hacking campaign**: SilkBean, CarbonSteal, DoubleAgent and GoldenEagle.

![tracking muslims](assets/images/posts/2020-10-03-tracking-muslim.jpg)

Once **infected apps** are downloaded to a device, hackers have **a real-time view** of **every activity** on the phone.

In some situations, hackers only need to send an invisible text message to the user to get data on that specific phone. The malware would simply **send the data** via SMS and quickly **erase all traces** of those messages.

This way, the user never notices that their **data is stolen**. And in order to **avoid further suspicion**, hackers are also able to kill their spyware, especially in situations where the application appears to be consuming too much battery.

## Forced sterilization of Uighurs

Uyghur women are systematically **forcibly sterilized**, an [Associated Press](https://jamestown.org/product/sterilizations-iuds-and-mandatory-birth-control-the-ccps-campaign-to-suppress-uyghur-birthrates-in-xinjiang/) investigation revealed on Monday June 29th.

When they are pregnant, they **have no choice** but **to have an abortion**. Adopted with the aim of **eradicating the Uyghur people**, these actions led to a **drop** in their birth rate by **24%** during the year **2019**. These sterilizations and abortions are carried out at the entrance to the **concentration camps**.

Women are also **separated** from **their children** and very often the latter disappear.

Some women say they **were forced** to **be sterilized** under **threat** of being sent **to camps**. Others would have been **forced** to **implant an IUD**.
