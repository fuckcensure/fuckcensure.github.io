    "body": "2019/10/03 - For several years, journalists and researchers had suspected the installation of “re-education” camps for Uyghur minorities in China. A fairly comprehensive report published in November 2018 by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) gathered evidence, especially from satellite images of the existence of these camps. The Uyghur population in China: Uyghurs are a Turkish-speaking and Sunni Muslim people living in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.  They are 11 million of the 14 million Muslims in the region. It is estimated that at least 800,000 of them are locked up in camps. The repression against the Uyghurs has especially increased since the deadly riots of 2009. China, which initially denied this political and police repression, ended up admitting the existence of these camps “to educate” the Uyghur population. Xinjiang Internment Camps: These are camps located in the Chinese province of Xinjiang, built from 2014 with the aim of interning hundreds of thousands of practicing Uyghur and Kazakh Muslims. One million Uyghurs are believed to be interned there preventively and without trial as part of a vast anti-terrorism campaign targeting Islamists and separatists after numerous attacks in 2013 and 2014. China denies the existence of these camps before officially recognizing their existence in October 2018 under the name of “re-education camps”. She describes them as vocational training centers, with the aim of combating Muslim terrorism and extremism. Abroad, several countries and NGOs qualify these camps as concentration camps and stress the conditions of detention which violate human rights. Here is a map, which brings together many re-education camps, visible through a satellite view.

Its total floor area increased during this period, from 12,200 m² to 129,600 m². This represents a size increase of 1062. 3%. Coordinates: 39°21’27. 64”N, 76°3’2. 39”E Through satellite and imagery analysis, the physical features of the camp - including barricaded facilities, watchtowers and enclosures surrounded by barbed wire - can be clearly seen. This also makes it possible to prove that it is indeed a camp to lock up Muslims. Images of “Bitter Winter” from the Chengnan Training Center. The photo features described above correspond to contours of the same color in the satellite imagery. The ASPI report covers 28 camps, which represents only a sample of re-education camps in Xinjiang estimated at more than a 100th, or even 1200 if the provisional camps are taken into account. The study shows that the size of these camps increased sharply between 2016 and 2018. Which leads us to wonder if the situation has only worsened, from the start, to what could be described as genocide. Mass espionage of the Uyghur population: A Lookout Threat Intelligence report found that China was using malware to track the Uyghur people. This surveillance activity was observed as early as 2013. Four Android tools are used in this hacking campaign: SilkBean, CarbonSteal, DoubleAgent and GoldenEagle.  Once infected apps are downloaded to a device, hackers have a real-time view of every activity on the phone. In some situations, hackers only need to send an invisible text message to the user to get data on that specific phone. The malware would simply send the data via SMS and quickly erase all traces of those messages. This way, the user never notices that their data is stolen. And in order to avoid further suspicion, hackers are also able to kill their spyware, especially in situations where the application appears to be consuming too much battery. Forced sterilization of Uighurs: Uyghur women are systematically forcibly sterilized, an Associated Press investigation revealed on Monday June 29th. When they are pregnant, they have no choice but to have an abortion. Adopted with the aim of eradicating the Uyghur people, these actions led to a drop in their birth rate by 24% during the year 2019. These sterilizations and abortions are carried out at the entrance to the concentration camps. Women are also separated from their children and very often the latter disappear. Some women say they were forced to be sterilized under threat of being sent to camps. Others would have been forced to implant an IUD. "
